## Manual Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases/latest) of the mod as a .zip file
- In Artemis, go to Settings -> Plugins, click "Import plugin", and select the downloaded archive
- The plugin will automatically install Fabric and the [ArtemisMC mod](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases) on Minecraft

There is also a [Forge version](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC-Forge) if needed, but Artemis won't automatically download it yet.

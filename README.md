[![GitHub release version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/urfour/ArtemisMC-Plugin.svg)](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases)

Artemis plugin for Minecraft Game State Integration.

## Standard Installation

- Just install the plugin from the Artemis Workshop!

## Maunal Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases/latest) of the mod as a .zip file
- In Artemis, go to Settings -> Plugins, click "Import plugin", and select the downloaded archive
- The plugin will automatically install Fabric and the [ArtemisMC mod](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC/releases) on Minecraft
- Done!

If your Minecraft directory is located in the standard folder, Artemis will automatically install all the required files.
If not, you will need to manually install Fabric and the mod for the plugin to work properly.

There is also a [Forge version](https://github.com/urfour/ArtemisMC-Forge) if needed, but Artemis won't automatically download it.
